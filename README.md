# Enterscale
Survey Rest Api Example. Using Node.js, Sequelize and PostrgeSQL database.
I decided to use a relational database based on personal preference and also to connect data from different tables
I worked with PostgreSQL because it is really easy to use and set up and is very functional. And I used ElephantSQL as the database hosting service
